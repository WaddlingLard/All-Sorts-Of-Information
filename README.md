# All Sorts of Information

## Project Spec

### Theme
The purpose of this website is to act like a Wikipedia/Reddit hybrid, almost like Fandom. The goal is to provide brief information on topics that are surface-level and maybe some more in-depth topics. 
### Actions
You can interact with this website by being able to create different categories of topics. For example, you could create a new topic about Alligators or maybe you want a page with Spongebob. These pages then act like forms where people can post questions and form discussions around the topic. This is how the Wikipedia/Reddit combination comes into play. You can have these webpages with information that can quickly get users up to speed while also catering to the Reddit side of hosting mini-discussion boards where users can also talk about different aspects of the topic through questions or general posts. 
### Audience:
The audience is people seeking quick referenceable information or wanting to participate in discussions about the topics. These people could be enthusiasts of anime or food and can vary in different skill levels.
### Pages
1. Landing Page: This is the initial page into which a user loads.
2. Page holding all topics: This page will hold all of the references to the topic's web pages. 
3. Topic Page (Per Topic): This is the meat of the website. It will hold all of the information while also hosting the discussion boards and comments.
4. Discussion Board Page? (Per Topic Page): Unsure if this is needed as the topic page can hold everything, but it would be nice to have some separation for clarity.
5. About Us/Contact: Any information about the team and the mission.

### Data 
The data that is managed on this website can be divided into three categories (possibly 4). 
1. Webpage Topic Content: This type of content can vary according to the topic title, content, and even any images. It would be interesting to also have different attributes you could add to the topic that has a dynamically generated table similar to Wikipedia or Fandom. 
2. Discussion Board Posts: This content will contain the post's title, content which could involve text and even images.
3. Comments: This content will likely refrain from any images but will mainly be text.
4. Accounts (Stretch Goal): This is some way to tag a user and make it so that information on discussion board posts and comments can be referenced to a certain user. 

### Stretch Goals
There are many stretch goals that I would like to implement. Here is a list of several:
1. Account System: Some way to manage who posted what and a way to reference all their information. Almost like a profile board where you can see all of their posts and comments
2. Dynamically generate webpages for new topics: I'm unsure how I would handle this but, ideally, there should be a webpage creator where you feed in the new topic's content and it should generate a new topic webpage that has all of the information and can foster discussion posts. The current idea is to just have a fixed system where users can then interact with the existing pages. 
3. Variable themes: Make themes have the ability to be dynamic. For example, a light and a dark theme option. Maybe use a slider or button to toggle between the two options.
